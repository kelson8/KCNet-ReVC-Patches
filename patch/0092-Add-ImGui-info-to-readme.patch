 ## New features

-I have been working on getting ImGui working for a mod menu, so far I have a basic test with ImGui showing up, use the F9 key to open it.
-For now though there is no mouse showing on the screen for it, and it cannot be closed with the F9 keybind.
-I still need to work on it and make it right
+I have a ImGui menu fully working now, I will add screenshots and demos of it later. It has tons of features.
+
+I am trying to replicate a lot of features from the [Cheat Menu](https://github.com/user-grinch/Cheat-Menu/tree/master) that was on GTA San Andreas, 3, and Vice City
+
+Keybind for ImGui menu: F8
 
 ImGui keybind and start code has been added to /skel/win/win.cpp [here](https://git.internal.kelsoncraft.net/kelson8/re3/src/branch/miami/src/skel/win/win.cpp)
 It is on GS_PLAYING_GAME in the main loop under the gGameState switch state, so it won't show up in the main menu or anything for now.

 ImGui initialization and everything has been added to /extras/imgui_test.cpp
 
+ImGui has also been added to d3ddevice.cpp in librw before the games EndScene to show up.
+
+I still need to work on getting the menu moving on the screen, it is somewhat glitchy when moving it around but all the functions work in it.

 ## Changes
 
 * Added lua test support, copy utils/lua/test.lua into ReVC-Install/ViceExtended/lua_scripts folder for it to work.
