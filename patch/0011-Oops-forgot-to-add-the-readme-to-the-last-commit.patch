+## New features
+kelson8
+
+I have been working on getting ImGui working for a mod menu, so far I have a basic test with ImGui showing up, use the F9 key to open it.
+For now though there is no mouse showing on the screen for it, and it cannot be closed with the F9 keybind.
+I still need to work on it and make it right
+
+ImGui keybind and start code has been added to /skel/win/win.cpp [here](https://git.internal.kelsoncraft.net/kelson8/re3/src/branch/miami/src/skel/win/win.cpp)
+It is on GS_PLAYING_GAME in the main loop under the gGameState switch state, so it won't show up in the main menu or anything for now.
+
+
+ImGui initialization and everything has been added to /extras/imgui_test.cpp
+
