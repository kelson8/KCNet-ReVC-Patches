 ## Changes
 
 * Added lua test support, copy utils/lua/test.lua into ReVC-Install/ViceExtended/lua_scripts folder for it to work.
+Lua support is now toggleable in the ReVC.ini, if 'LuaTest' is set to 1 it'll run the lua file.
 
 I have been working on copying most of the changes from the Extended Vice project, it adds swimming, proper crouching support, better firing and aiming, first person and a lot more.
